## v0.7.0-rc1

This release candidate introduces a complete frontend rewrite and significant backend additions.

### What's New

#### Frontend
- **Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS SPA** — replaced vanilla JS/Bootstrap with a modern, reactive single-page application
- Vite-based build pipeline; assets embedded directly into the Go binary at build time
- Improved UI responsiveness and component structure

#### Authentication
- **bcrypt password hashing** — replaces plain-text password storage

#### Tailscale Management
- New Web UI section for Tailscale node information and status
- Tailscale hostname change now migrates existing Caddy proxy routes automatically

#### Caddy / Proxy
- **TLS certificate startup check** — validates certs on boot for `*.ts.net` proxies
- Replaced per-server metrics with global server metrics
- Caddy proxy hostnames migrate automatically when Tailscale hostname changes

#### Backup & Restore
- Full configuration backup and restore support via the Web UI

#### Other
- Improved logging throughout the backend
- Various bug fixes and stability improvements

### Upgrade Notes

- The frontend assets are now compiled via `make frontend-build` (Node 22 + Vite required for building from source)
- Docker image users: no action required — assets are pre-built in the image
- Password hashes are automatically upgraded to bcrypt on first login after upgrade
